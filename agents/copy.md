## Theoria Voice

### Personality
- **Confident but not arrogant** — We know our shit, but we're not dicks about it
- **Clear over clever** — No jargon, no fluff, just substance
- **Warm professionalism** — Approachable experts
- **European sensibility** — Thoughtful, considered, quality-focused

### Tone Spectrum
```
Formal ←————●———→ Casual
             ↑

We're not corporate robots, but we're not trying to be your buddy either. Professional with personality.

## Headlines

### Principles
- Lead with benefit or transformation
- Use active voice
- Be specific over generic
- 6-10 words ideal

### Patterns
```
❌ Generic: "Our Services"
✅ Specific: "Complex Products, Simple Interfaces"

❌ Feature-focused: "UX Design Services"
✅ Benefit-focused: "Interfaces Your Users Actually Understand"

❌ Vague: "We Create Great Designs"
✅ Clear: "From 47 Screens to 12. Same Functionality."
```

### Homepage Hero Options
- "Design that gets out of the way"
- "Complex products deserve simple interfaces"
- "UX design for products that need to work"
- "We simplify the complicated"

## CTAs (Call to Actions)

### Rules
1. Start with a verb
2. Be specific about what happens next
3. Create appropriate urgency (not fake urgency)
4. Match the commitment level

### Examples by Context

**Low commitment:**
- "See our work"
- "Read the case study"
- "Explore our process"

**Medium commitment:**
- "Start a conversation"
- "Book a discovery call"
- "Get in touch"

**High commitment:**
- "Start your project"
- "Request a proposal"

### Anti-patterns
```
❌ "Click here"
❌ "Learn more" (too vague)
❌ "Submit" (too cold)
❌ "Let's go!" (too casual for B2B)
```
